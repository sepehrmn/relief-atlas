# Defense Meshes: 3D Military & Defense Asset Dataset

A curated collection of **58 3D military meshes** (GLB format) covering Bundeswehr equipment, military vehicles, drones, weapons, and tactical gear. Designed for defense simulation environments, military training simulators, and robotics research.

Meshes are generated via text-to-image and image-to-3D pipelines. Text-to-image models include **Flux Schnell** and **GPT-Image-1.5**; image-to-3D models include **Trellis**, **Trellis 2** (primary), and **Hunyuan3D v3** (fallback). All 58 meshes include reference images.

> **Status**: Actively expanding. 22 additional meshes are defined in manifests and queued for generation. Target: 200+ defense assets.

## Dataset Structure

| File / Directory | Description |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | This file |
| `manifests/` | Mesh generation manifests with prompts and metadata |
| `scripts/` | Generation and management scripts |
| `outputs/bundeswehr/` | 33 Bundeswehr-specific meshes |
| `outputs/warzone/` | 25 tactical/military meshes |

Each mesh directory contains:
- `<mesh_name>.glb` — 3D mesh in GLB format (glTF 2.0 Binary)
- `<mesh_name>_reference.png` — Reference image used during generation

## Mesh Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Format** | GLB (glTF 2.0 Binary) |
| **Coordinate System** | Y-up, right-handed |
| **Scale** | Unit-normalized (~1 unit bounding box) |
| **Reference Images** | 58 of 58 meshes (100%) |

## Quick Start

```python
import trimesh
import json

# Load a single mesh
mesh = trimesh.load("outputs/bundeswehr/bundeswehr_vehicles/vehicle_Leopard_2A7/vehicle_Leopard_2A7.glb")
print(f"Vertices: {len(mesh.vertices)}, Faces: {len(mesh.faces)}")

# Load a manifest for batch processing
with open("manifests/mesh_manifest_bundeswehr.json") as f:
    manifest = json.load(f)

for item in manifest[:5]:
    print(f"  {item['id']}: {item.get('category', '?')}")
```

## Use Cases

1. **Military Simulation** — Training environments, wargaming, tactical planning
2. **Defense Robotics** — UGV/UAV interaction with military equipment
3. **VR/AR Training** — Immersive military equipment familiarization
4. **Synthetic Data** — Domain randomization for object detection and recognition
5. **Academic Research** — Defense-related computer vision and simulation
