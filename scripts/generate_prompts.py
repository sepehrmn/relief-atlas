    "It is configured for winter operations with tire chains wrapped around the wheels, a heated equipment enclosure on top, antifreeze container markings on the side, and cold-weather insulation wrap on exposed pipes.",

    "It is at a staging area with all equipment fully deployed and ready, doors and hatches open showing the interior, all indicator lights and systems active.",
